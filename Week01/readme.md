# Hello World - Interactive Web Page

## Project Overview

This is my first project in the CSE310 semester program! This simple "Hello World" web page demonstrates basic HTML and CSS concepts with an interactive hover effect.

## Purpose

As a foundational project in web development, this serves as my introduction to:
- HTML structure and semantic markup
- CSS styling and responsive design
- Creating interactive user experiences

## Features

- **Clean, centered design** with responsive layout
- **Smooth color transition** when hovering over the text
- **Cross-browser compatibility** using standard web technologies
- **Single-file architecture** for easy deployment and sharing

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Page structure and content
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, and smooth transitions
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Interactive hover effects and DOM manipulation

## How It Works

1. The page displays "Hello World" text centered on the screen
2. When you hover your mouse over the text, it smoothly transitions from dark gray to coral red
3. When you move your mouse away, it transitions back to the original color
4. The effect is implemented using both CSS `:hover` pseudo-class and JavaScript event listeners

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional dependencies or installations required

### Running the Project
1. Download the HTML file
2. Open it in your preferred web browser
3. Hover over the "Hello World" text to see the color change effect

## File Structure

```

## Code Highlights

- **Responsive Design**: Uses flexbox for perfect centering
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions create fluid color changes
- **Event Handling**: JavaScript adds interactivity beyond basic CSS hover
- **Best Practices**: Semantic HTML, organized CSS, and clean JavaScript

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Setting up a basic web page structure
- Applying CSS styles for visual presentation
- Implementing JavaScript event listeners
- Creating smooth user interactions
- Understanding the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
